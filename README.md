## DEMO
You can test the App from [here.](https://filla0.github.io/Movie-search-app/)

## App features
This is a movie search app which will provide you information and poster of movies.I will follow the [NETFLIX](https://www.netflix.com/nl-en/) website style and gonna use movie api website to get movie information.

### Must have:-
- [x] Design of the app should fits the NETFLIX website style.
- [x] The user can search different kinds of movies.
- [x] The movie search information should show
   - [x] Released year
   - [x] Genre
   - [x] Name of Writer
   - [x] Name of Actors
   - [x] Plot
   - [x] language they used in the movie
   - [x] How many awards the movie won
- [x] The app needs to have loading/error handling for the interaction with the API.
- [x] The app needs some user interaction such that you need to grab different data from the API. So you cannot just grab everything from the API and store it locally with one fetch.

### Nice to have features:
- [ ] The user can search a movie with by its categorie for example(Sereis, Full movies, Sitcom, ...)
- [ ] Make special design for Mobile
